# Admin Dashboard

# Overview

This project is an Admin Dashboard built as part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course in The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of the project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of CSS Grid by building a responsive, structured dashboard layout using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

The dashboard layout includes a sidebar for navigation, a header section for user actions and search, and a main content area displaying project cards.
